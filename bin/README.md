### JAVA TIC TAC TOE GAME 

Implemented as a GUI using the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern.

##### Currently
Currently this game is very primitive. The GUI isn't very flashy and it is not the most user friendly.

##### //TODO
Add a "Who's turn it is" panel to inform the players of whose turn it is. 
Change the colour of the buttons depending on whether it was played by O or X.
